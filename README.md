Use the long-term support version (LTS) of Unity. At the moment this is [2017.4](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases). | Visual Studio can be used to edit the code. It has provides debugging tools for Unity. | The MixedRealityToolkit is an auxiliary resource which provides building blocks and an architecture for accessing the Mixed Reality hardware. |

## Project Description

This repository contains two prototypes which demonstrate different ways how to realize AR reading on the HoloLens.

## Build

First, a Visual Studio solution has be generated from the Unity project.
After that, the app can be deloyed using Visual Studio.
